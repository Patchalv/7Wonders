# 7Wonders Calculator
This is a JavaScript calculator used to dynamically calculate the scores in the [7 Wonders](https://pages.github.com/) board game by Repos productions.

This is a game that I frequently play with friends, to the point that we've run out of the paper scorepads that come with the game. For this reason it seemed like a fun little project to put together as not only helped me practice, but I can also share it with friends! 


To Do:
-----
- [ ] Tidy up the javaScript.
- [ ] Add ability to add/remove columns so that anywhere between 3-8 players could be scored.
- [ ] 1st, 2nd and 3rd bage added at the bottom to indicate in what position each player is in. 
- [ ] Add a backend functionality so that scores can be saved and used for analytics, etc.
