# 7Wonders Calculator
Mini project to create a score calculator for the 7 Wonders board game. For the moment this is a simple HTML/JavaScript that can be used live in the desktop.

Issues
-----
* I still haven't worked out how to get all of the inputs to add up properly.
* How to get the add function to happen each time any input changed.
